## Features

- Automatic linking of notes
- Uses Wikilink format
- Skip links in metadata
- Skip links in codeblocks, inline code

## Linking Process

1. **Scan Files**: The tool scans all the markdown files in your Obsidian vault.
2. **Extract Filenames**: It extracts the filenames from the scanned files.
3. **Match Filenames**: It matches the filenames with the content in other files, ignoring the case.
4. **Insert Links**: When a match is found, it inserts a Wikilink in the content, preserving the original case of the filename in the link.
5. **Skip Metadata and Code**: The tool skips adding links in metadata sections and code blocks to avoid unwanted linking.

### Examples

- **Simple Linking**: If a file named `Object-Oriented Programming.md` exists and another file mentions "object-oriented programming", the tool will link it as `[[object-oriented programming]]`.
- **Preserve Case**: If the mention is "Object-Oriented Programming", the link will be `[[Object-Oriented Programming]]`.
- **No Links in Code Blocks**: Mentions inside code blocks are ignored.
- **No Links in Metadata**: Mentions inside metadata sections are ignored.
- **Multiple Links**: If multiple files are mentioned, each will be linked appropriately.
- **Partial Matches**: If a file named `Object.md` exists, mentions of "object" will be linked as `[[object]]`, but "objects" will not be linked.
- **Complex Linking**: If files named `Object-Oriented Programming.md`, `Functional Programming.md`, and `Object.md` exist, and another file mentions "object-oriented programming", "functional programming", and "object", each will be linked as `[[object-oriented programming]]`, `[[functional programming]]`, and `[[object]]` respectively. Note "object" will not be added inside "object-oriented programming".
